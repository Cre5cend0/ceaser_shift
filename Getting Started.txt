To get started, download the file. Extract it to your working directory. The files inside are:

main.py - a file containing classes to encrpy or decrypt message
words.txt - a file containing valid English words (should be in the same folder as your main.py file). 
story.txt - a file containing an encrypted message that you will have to decode (should be in the same folder as your main.py file).

###
You can Encrypt a message using the following:

message = PlaintextMessage("Your text message to be encrypted", key) # replace key with a number < 26
print(message.get_message_text_encrypted())

###
To Decrypt a message, copy your encrypted message into story.txt and run main.py
